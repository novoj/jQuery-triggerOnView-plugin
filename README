Trigger On View jQuery Plugin

With the help of this plugin you can achieve similar functionality as you can see on Twitter infinitely loading
your wall contents.

Plugin will help you automatically trigger standard event when specified DOM element gets into the user view
(ie. end of your content). Example usage:

//add autoclick with standard settings to any dom element
$("#myElement").triggerOnView();
//customize plugin settings for the call
$("#myElement").triggerOnView({
    debug           : false,      //displays debugging info in the browser
    eventType       : 'click',    //type of the event that should be triggered on the targeted element
    verticalRange   : 0,          //vertical offset to expand reaction area (you may need to trigger event even
                                  //before element gets into the view, but user is in the vicinity of it)
    horizontalRange : 0,          //horizontal offset to expand reaction area
    singleShotOnly  : true,       //true if event should be triggered only once when element become visible
    callback        : null        //function that should be invoked just before event triggering, if the function
                                  //returns false, triggering is stopped
                                  //function signature: function(domElement, settings)
});
